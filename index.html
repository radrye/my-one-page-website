	      <p>Ahoy! Here at S/V Cinderella we aim to inspire, teach, and motivate. S/V Cinderella is a dream, a dream to explore the world around us whether out sailing across the world or by simply opening our eyes.
    	  </p>
          <p>About a year ago, as I sat, much like I am right now, in a hip, Seattle cafe, I was overwhelmed by an idea. That idea would soon spur into loads of fun, some crazy experiences, and hopefully take me onward to a lifetime of learning. I decided I was going to sail around the world. Prior to this moment, I had true knowledge of what that meant. I was naive enough to think it was a novel idea. I didn’t have the boat, I didn’t have the skills, I didn’t really even know where to begin.
          </p>
          <p>Fast forward nine months, and I still probably haven’t made much headway on any of those, except the boat. I have been a sponge - scouring forums, YouTube, heaps of books, and chatting up any sailor who had been “out there.” Even then I think I only know enough to be dangerous. After all, the sea in a mysterious entity and Cinderella is a small boat.
          </p>
          <p>Come! Join me on my journey as I learn boat carpentry, fiberglass, engines, motors, plumbing, circuitry, and sailing.

	    	<h5>Heading 5 #theboat: There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</h5>

	    	<h4>Heading 4 #thetrip: Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</h4>

	    	<h3>Heading 3 #thedream: "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</h3>
